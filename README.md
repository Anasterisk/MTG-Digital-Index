# MTG-Card-Compiler
A Magic the Gathering Api that allows you compile your deck

For this project, I will be assembling an Magic the Gathering Online Deck building site

# Objective
I will be developing a site that'll allow you create an account, build decks by adding and removing cards, and upload cards yourself

##Stretch objective
Cards with multiple variations will be displayed within it own detailed page once you select one of its various iterations.
Create an interactable card that allows you pick and adjust the traits of the templete card to search the api for cards that fit it's description. E.G the mana color and cost can be filtered in the top right side of the templete where the mana color and cost is normally found on the card.

## Layout

The most general layout would most likely be this with the top left panel being the stretch goal layout.
